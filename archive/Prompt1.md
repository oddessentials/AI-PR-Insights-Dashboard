Our goal is to identify a real, research-backed problem in an industry of your choice. Then, conduct market and competitor analysis to uncover opportunities, and develop a cohesive product plan articulating value, users, AI-powered features, and differentiation. Our total deliverable will be a 4-6 page report. Confirm your high level undertanding of this blueprint before I move on with the specific topic we'll be focusing on.

Considerations
Start with user empathy, not technology. Use credible data to support claims; cite sources. Keep your positioning statement crisp (use Moore’s template). Include visuals: competitor maps, feature tables, mockups. Write as if presenting to a leadership team or investors.
