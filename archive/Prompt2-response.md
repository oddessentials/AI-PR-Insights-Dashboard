## üß© Part 1 ‚Äî Market Research (100 points)

### **1. Problem Recap (‚âà ¬Ω page / 10 pts)**

**Target profession:** Engineering leaders, software engineering managers, DevOps analysts, and data scientists.
**Core pain:** Organizations using **Azure DevOps (Azure Repos)** lack holistic, cross-repository analytics for Pull Requests (PRs). Native tools and APIs restrict how far leaders can see into review health, collaboration, and productivity trends.

**Evidence to include:**

* Azure DevOps OData feed excludes PR entities (Microsoft Docs citation).
* REST API limitations: pagination, no historical snapshot queries, no comment metrics.
* Managerial pain: cannot quantify review participation or identify bottlenecks.
* Business impact: engineering leaders fly blind on review cycle time and team load.

Add a short **use-case vignette** (e.g., ‚ÄúA Director of Engineering with 200 developers across 30 repos cannot see who reviews what or why delays occur.‚Äù).

### **2. Market Landscape Overview (‚âà 1¬Ω‚Äì2 pages / 30 pts)**

Research and present **3‚Äì5 products** that address developer-analytics and code-review health.

| Product                                | Company                 | Key Features                                        | Target Users                       | Pricing Model         | Strengths                        | Limitations                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Pluralsight Flow**                   | Pluralsight             | Code review metrics, PR cycle time, team throughput | Eng. Leaders (Managers ‚Üí CTO)      | Per-user subscription | Strong visuals & benchmarks      | Weak ADO integration, GitHub-biased           |

### **3. Gap Analysis (‚âà ¬æ page / 25 pts)**

Summarize what current tools miss:

| Gap                                         | Impact                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| No comprehensive PR data extraction in ADO  | Incomplete visibility into review health                    |
| APIs limit time-series or historical trends | Leaders can‚Äôt see improvement over time                     |
| Lack of cross-repo aggregation              | Impossible to compare teams or projects                     |
| Minimal AI/automation                       | Manual reporting, no intelligent summaries or predictions   |
| Scalability issues on large datasets        | Enterprise users can‚Äôt analyze thousands of PRs efficiently |

Narratively, emphasize: **the existing market favors GitHub, not Azure DevOps.** This is a defensible, research-based differentiation.
