Consider the following before we begin. Does this sound like a problem we can fit into our project plan or do you have any concerns or better ideas?

Domain: Engineering	
Example Knowledge Workers: Developers, data scientists, software enigneering leadership
AI Product Idea: Azure DevOps git pull request analyzer

Problem Recap: It is difficult to analyze engineer productivity and participation in the code review process within Azure DevOps. There are several ado plugins/add-ons that either offer limited analysis, break on large datasets, or do not span across timeframes and repositories necessary to draw intelligent conclusions. The make matters worse, Micrsoft does not provide an Odata feed for Pull Request data. The Azure DevOps REST APIs only provide limited views of Pull Request data (again constrained by the parameters of the API). This makes analyzing large organizations Azure DevOps difficult, if not impossible, using the readily available tools and options research so far.
